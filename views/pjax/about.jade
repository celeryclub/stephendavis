    | I like to write music in my spare time. I released an EP in 2009 that you can download for free from NoiseTrade â€“ it&rsquo;s called 
    a(href='http://noisetrade.com/stephendavis') If Music be the Food of Love
    |. I have some of my newer work 
    a(href='http://soundcloud.com/stephendavis89') posted on SoundCloud
    |  too.
  p In my spare time I write and record beautiful music and study Russian. Also programming.
